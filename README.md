# node ava es6 template

Simple node.js template to setup a project. I use VS Code hence the ```.eslintrc.json``` file.

Ava is the testing tool, it is simple and reduces excessive time writing tests. It is always powerful and efficient, cutting down tests before deployment.

Everything is setup to run ES6 but you may need to add any extra es6+ modules outside of the base set.   

## tools used: ##
* Ava - simple, powerful test runner, es6 compatible https://github.com/avajs/ava
* Babel - es6 transpiling
